shell 

shell - cmd interface to communicate with kernel

sebang line use - #!/bin/bash/ - it tells os which interpreter to use to parse the rest of the file
-f folderpath - to check where file exist or not
-d /directory - to check if directory exist
exit status - 0 means successful
readonly variablename= value (value will not get change)
$# - this will tell us how many arguement are passed in the script
= used for to check if 2 strings are equal

$* $@
>>file.txt 2>&1 (this will print all the error and logs in file.txt file.
read -p "your name" name (this will ask user for the input)
./script param1 param2 - second way to take input from user
how to check if user is root - we can check the root id it should be 0
hardlink-
softlink-
we can use -h and -L to check if link is hardlink or softlink
we can use set -x to debug the script
cat /etc/shells - this will show total number of shells
$$ - this will give us current process id
we can call multiple scripts at a time we can use script name with the script
while true - we can use to make infinite loop
${0} - this we can use check the name of the script
function name {
  code
}
function(){}
du -sh /home/aman - to check the space under folder
journalctl -u servicename - to check the logs of the service


if we don't want to print output on terminal as well as on in file we can redirect output to dev/null
sleep 1s - this will hold the script for 1s
$? - to check status of the script

backup jenkins - we can take a backup of .jenkins folder using async
handles secret in jenkins - hashicorp vault we can use to securely store our secrets or credential plugin we can install and use to store secrets 
jenkins latest version - 2.346.1

new worker node in jenkins - manage jenkins - manage nodes -new node
new plugin - manage jenkins - manage plugin 
JNLP - this allows master node to talk to child nodes in jenkins
to update url in ui - manage jenkins - configure system - jenkins /etc/default/jenkins

manage jenkins - users - create user
manage jenkins - plugins - role based authentication 
manage jenkins - security - role base authentication
manage jenkins - manage and assign roles 

plugin issue - we can rollback the update and see if it resolved or we can refer document of plugin
if userface slowness in jenkins - we can start looking jenkins system metrics such as cpu utilization,memory usuage disk io etc. we can check the configuration how jenkins
executing builds , build queue management, plugin usuage etc additionally we can think of horizontally or vertically scalling jenkins.
to check the vulnerability on the application which are deployed by jenkins we can use the security vulnerability scanning tools such as ZAP,OWASP,Trivy etc. in post build steps.
manage multiple git branches each with its own jenkins pipeline how we can manage pipeline effectively - we can make use of jenkins multibranch pipeline so that it 
can detect and build branches based on predefined pipeline configuration stored in source control.
we can utilize jenkins credential plugin to securely store and manage credentials for accessing external services such as api token,ssh keys etc.
jenkins notification plugin - we can make use of this plugin to send notifications to teams slack email etc.

jenkins pipeline - it means pipeline as a code , free style pipeline - it is pipeline configuration from UI.
Declarative pipeline - simpler workflow, structured and simplified syntax
Scripted pipeline - Complex scenario and Flexibility and control.
jenkins shared library - here we can have our groovy resused code which we can refer in a pipeline.
jenkins blue ocean - it is extensive version of jenkins ui
jenkins x - CI CD solution for kubernetive application.
